/**
 * Test Script: Simplified Notification Flow
 * 
 * This script verifies that the simplified notification flow works correctly:
 * 1. When a notification's "View task" action is pressed
 * 2. The app opens directly with a task completion/update dialog
 * 3. No additional notifications are triggered
 * 
 * Test Steps:
 * 1. Install the app: ./gradlew installDebug
 * 2. Create a task with a reminder
 * 3. Wait for the notification or trigger it manually
 * 4. Tap the notification
 * 5. Verify the app opens with the TaskActionDialog
 * 6. Test both "Complete" and "Edit" actions
 * 7. Verify no additional notifications are shown
 * 
 * Expected Behavior:
 * - Tapping notification opens app directly to TaskList screen
 * - TaskActionDialog appears automatically for the specific task
 * - Dialog shows task information and action buttons
 * - "Complete" button marks task as completed and closes dialog
 * - "Edit" button navigates to TaskForm screen for editing
 * - No additional notifications are triggered
 * 
 * Key Changes Made:
 * 1. TaskActionNotificationManager.kt:
 *    - Simplified to create single notification that opens app directly
 *    - Passes task_action_id and from_notification extras to MainActivity
 * 
 * 2. MainActivity.kt:
 *    - Added handling for taskActionId parameter
 *    - Passes taskActionId to App composable
 * 
 * 3. App.kt:
 *    - Added taskActionId parameter throughout navigation chain
 *    - Sets initial screen to TaskList when taskActionId is provided
 * 
 * 4. TaskListScreen.kt:
 *    - Added taskActionId parameter
 *    - Shows TaskActionDialog when taskActionId is provided
 *    - Handles task completion and editing from dialog
 * 
 * 5. TaskActionDialog.kt:
 *    - New component for handling task actions from notifications
 *    - Provides clean UI for completing or editing tasks
 * 
 * 6. DismissAndViewTaskReceiver.kt:
 *    - Updated to use simplified notification method
 * 
 * Manual Testing Commands:
 * 
 * # Install the app
 * ./gradlew installDebug
 * 
 * # Start the app
 * adb shell am start -n cl.jlopezr.multiplatform/.MainActivity
 * 
 * # Simulate notification with task action (replace TASK_ID with actual task ID)
 * adb shell am start -n cl.jlopezr.multiplatform/.MainActivity \
 *   -e from_notification true \
 *   -e task_action_id "TASK_ID"
 * 
 * # Check logs for any errors
 * adb logcat -s "AgendaTareas"
 * 
 * Verification Points:
 * ✓ App compiles without errors
 * ✓ TaskActionDialog appears when opening from notification
 * ✓ Dialog shows correct task information
 * ✓ "Complete" action works correctly
 * ✓ "Edit" action navigates to TaskForm
 * ✓ No additional notifications are triggered
 * ✓ App doesn't crash when task is not found
 * ✓ Dialog can be dismissed properly
